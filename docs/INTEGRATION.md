# PR Manager integration receipt

Reviewed 26 October 2026. This receipt records the initial integration checkout
and bootstrap evidence; it does not admit analytical work or qualify modules.

## Checkout and provenance

- Integration repository: `/Users/ericguei/Documents/Deploy Workflow`
- Branch and starting HEAD: `codex/checkpoint` at
  `df26ea82249fc062a8beb8dba3d51f1caf5fdf23`.
- `git status` was clean before this receipt. No Git remote is configured.
- The selected source snapshot is Claude worktree commit
  `6441553936086c834be885e2f3d7cd7f0959aa5c`.
- `docs/reuse/manifest.json` records 108 source/resource entries and SHA256
  values; `docs/BOOTSTRAP-REVIEW.md` reports that all 108 destination bytes
  matched the pinned source blobs and their manifest hashes. The selected 85
  Python modules imported from this repository in its own `.venv`; offline
  dependency setup also succeeded. These are provenance/setup checks, not
  functional or module-completion evidence.
- The import is selective and has no copied Git history. Provider clients,
  credentials, ledgers, runners, private packs, run artifacts and bulk legacy
  tests/plans were excluded. The known historical failed-render evidence risk,
  incomplete bindings, and missing owners remain open as listed in
  `docs/reuse/README.md`.

## Clean clone integration process

1. Clone or copy this local repository into an independent integration checkout;
   confirm the base commit, branch, clean status and absence/presence of remotes.
   Team clone paths and identities belong in `docs/TEAM.json` under LEAD's
   ownership.
2. Accept a candidate only after LEAD records its specific commit and exclusive
   task/file lease in `docs/QUEUE.md`. Preserve the coordinator's checkout and
   evidence; do not bulk-import old history or merge unadmitted work.
3. Verify the candidate's exact parent/base, changed paths, manifest impact and
   diff. Require a concrete handoff with commands/results, actual supported tool
   invocation and submission/settlement lineage where applicable, independently
   fixed expected results, and an independent Sol/high review for sensitive
   semantics. Check that applicable focused tests and required code-review
   workflows have completed before integration.
4. Integrate only the admitted commit or patch after the evidence is reviewable.
   Record commit identity, files, checks, review evidence and remaining limits
   here or in a linked receipt. Keep this integration branch local unless the
   user later authorizes a remote action.

## Handoff and review requirements

Each handoff must identify the starting commit, exact owned files and behavior,
independent positive and refusal/gap expectations, implementation model/effort
route, candidate commit, and the actual verification evidence. Sensitive
financial/state/provenance expectations need independent Sol/high review.
Before any later integration commit, follow `AGENTS.md`: run confidence-review
after code changes, enumerate and resolve least-confident points, and run
rewrite-tournament in no-argument post-edit mode on changed non-trivial
functions. Do not make module-completion claims from imports, mocks, review files
or direct composers alone.

## Current checks and limits

- Bootstrap evidence was reviewed in `docs/BOOTSTRAP-REVIEW.md`; no heavy checks
  were rerun for this receipt.
- The initial receipt preceded team registration. Bootstrap subsequently
  registered all four chat IDs and independent clone paths in `docs/TEAM.json`
  and dispatched Task0, C1/C2 preparation and this integration receipt.
  `docs/QUEUE.md` records those handoffs; no heavy job was reserved by bootstrap.
- No analytical module is accepted. Actual host tool execution, validated and
  settled output, downstream consumption, rendered sections and case-level
  evidence remain outstanding.
- No external GitHub remote is configured. No PR URL, push, publication,
  credential setup or production activation exists.
- Live/paid/provider testing remains paused. Preserve the one-heavy-job and
  two-disjoint-lane limits; LEAD must admit resource use after checking actual
  processes. No heavy job was started for this review.
